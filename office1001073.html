  <h2>DMTP/DNMTP (Delayed non-matching-to-position) (#6,7)</h2>

  This is a widely task to measure working memory from rodent to human. The subject is required to remember the position of the touched panel for a certain delay and chose the same panel (DMTP) or opposite panel (DNMTP) at the choice phase. To prevent the subject from using their body location as a cue, they are required to touch the center panel just before and after the delay. <br clear="all">
  This task is consist of &quot;acquisition&quot; and &quot;test&quot; blocks. In the acquisition block, the delay is minimum to make the subject learn the rule of the task (delay time specified as delay0 is used). The task result is checked after each session and once the criteria which is defined in RateTh and DayTh is achieved, it moves to the test block. In the test block, the delay continues to change from delay0 to delay9 day by day to increase the burden of working memory. The following table shows which delays are used on which day in the test block.<br clear="all">

  <h2>Delayed alternation (#8)</h2>
  <br clear="all">
  This is a simple spatial working memory task where correct and incorrect panels are displayed and touching the correct one is rewarded. Correct position is switched every trial and there is a delay between correct panel touching and reward onset thus the subject has to remember the position of the previous correct panel to predict the next correct position. This task is composed of 2 blocks. One is the acquisition block where only a delay specified as Delay0 is used. The correct rate is checked at the end of the session and if it exceeds the value specified in &quot;RateTh&quot; for a number of consecutive days specified in &quot;DayTh&quot;, it moves on the delay block. In the delay block, the delay changes day by day as shown below and then move to the next task.<br clear="all">

  <h2>Habitual behavior (#12)</h2>
  <br clear="all">
  This task includes a series of tests for the perseverative behavior (ref: Rossi et al., Curr Protoc Neurosci, 2012). To establish the repetitive daily routine, it can perform random interval (RI) and random rate (RR) training. In RI, the subject gets reward if it touches the lit panel after a randomly determined latency. In RR, the reward is given at a certain rate when the subject touches the lit panel. After learning those behavior, it can test how much the subject obsesses to its learned behavior with devaluation and omission tests. In devaluation test, the subject is given foods and water for 1 hour and then put the chamber and measured how many times it touches the panel. In omission test, the subject can get reward by just ignoring the lit panel for 20 seconds.<br clear="all">

  This task presents correct and incorrect panels. The difference from the spatial discrimination is that neither the correct and incorrect panel touching result in reward and punishment respectively at 100%.

  This task is similar with the conventional probabilistic reversal learning task but has additional center panel touch phase and switching of the correct and incorrect panels within the session. After the touching of the center panel, the correct and incorrect panels are displayed which reward and punish at a certain rate.

  I recommend using the monitor with thin frame and the IR sensor bar to reduce a gap between monitor and mask to minimize blind spots the both sides panels (also don't forget to omit the chamber spacer and use the 1.5mm monitor spacers). Extending panels in both sides horizontally (see below) is also an effective way to minimize the blind spot.<br clear="all">
